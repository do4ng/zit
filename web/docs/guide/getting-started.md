# Getting Started

## Overview

Zit.js is very simple Javascript Framework to build basic site. This package was born because many frameworks (like [React](https://reactjs.org)) are so heavy to build simple web. So this package is not suitable for heavy projects. Instead, it is quick and easy.

## Installation

with [cdn](https://www.unpkg.com/zitjs)

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/zitjs/dist/browser.js" type="module"></script>
```

```js
const { html, createElement } = window.zitjs;
```

with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zitjs)

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev zitjs
$ yarn add -D zitjs
```

```js
import { html, createElement } from 'zitjs';
```
